A Signup page for any website
Signup pages, also known as “registration pages,” aren’t all the same. Some are PPC post-click landing pages; others are linked to the homepage via navigation – some even are the homepage. Despite their differences, they all share the same goal: generate sign-ups for a service.

In many cases, the signup page is the last step in a business’s conversion funnel. It’s where prospects navigate after they’ve evaluated a brand and decided its service offers what they need.

Because of that, signup pages focus less on persuading the prospect to convert and more on minimizing the friction involved in doing it. That focus on usability means other traditional post-click landing page elements like social proof, testimonials, and attention-grabbing media take a backseat.
